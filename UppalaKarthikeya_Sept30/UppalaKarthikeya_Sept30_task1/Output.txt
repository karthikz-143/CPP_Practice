Array elements using subscript notation: 2 4 6 8 10
Array elements using pointer/offset notation: 2 4 6 8 10
Array elements using array name as pointer: 2 4 6 8 10
Array elements using pointer subscript notation: 2 4 6 8 10
Accessing 5th element of array in multiple ways:
values[4] = 10
*(values + 4) = 10
vPtr[4] = 10
*(vPtr + 4) = 10

--- Addressing Demonstration ---
Address referenced by vPtr + 3: 0x7774fff79c
Value at that address: 8
After vPtr -= 4, address referenced: 0x7774fff790
Value stored at that address: 2
