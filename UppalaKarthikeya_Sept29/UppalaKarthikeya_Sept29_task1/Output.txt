Array elements (Array Subscript Notation):
0.0 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9
Array elements (Pointer/Offset with pointer):
0.0 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9
Array elements (Pointer/Offset with array name):
0.0 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9
Array elements (Pointer/Subscript Notation):
0.0 1.1 2.2 3.3 4.4 5.5 6.6 7.7 8.8 9.9
Fourth element access in different ways:
Array subscript: 3.3
Pointer/Offset with array name: 3.3
Pointer subscript with nPtr: 3.3
Pointer/Offset with nPtr: 3.3
Pointer arithmetic demonstration:
Address referenced by nPtr + 8: 0x32025ffc00
Value at nPtr + 8: 8.8
Address referenced after nPtr -= 4: 0x32025ffbc8
Value at that address: 1.1
